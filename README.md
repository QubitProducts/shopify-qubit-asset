Shopify Universal Variable Templates
====================================

Universal Variable provides a standardised JSON structure for data relating to the user journey of your visitors, such user details, products viewed and transactions. Data contained in Universal Variable are pushed automatically to Qubitâ€™s platform and Opentag scripts.

The code in this repository will take away 95% of the development work required in implementing Universal Variable on your Shopify store.

#Overview

When implementing [Universal Variable](http://tools.qubitproducts.com/uv) and [Opentag](http://www.qubitproducts.com/tag-management), you need to do two things from a technical perspective:

1. Add the Opentag container to the `<head>` of every page
2. Add the Universal Variable (UV) directly before the Opentag container on every page.

The code in this repository handles both of these for you, using Shopify templates.

__Note__: This repository is not a Shopify App as such, it provides a series of sample logic that can be copied across to your [Shopify templates](http://docs.shopify.com/themes).


#Installation

##Opentag container

Update the Opentag container at the bottom of `uv.liquid` and `uv-transaction.liquid` with your own unique id.


##Sitewide

To install the bulk of the Universal Variable code, copy the `uv.liquid` file from this repository to the `Snippets/` directory, found at "Themes > Template Editor > Snippets".

Then at the bottom of the `<head>` in `theme.liquid` in the `Layouts/` directory, add the following code:

```liquid
{% include 'uv' %}
```


##Confirmation page

The Shopify template system does now allow codes to be added to the confirmation page (after a purchase has been made), but it does provide separate functionality to what's required.

Copy the code from `uv-transaction.liquid` in this repository, and paste it into the textbox found at: "Settings > Checkout > Additional content & scripts".



#Useful notes

* There are a lot of inline JavaScript comments within the templates. If you do not want these to be publicly accessible, we recommend removing them.
* This code in this repository handles the vast majority of the Universal Variable implementation. However if you're looking to do something more custom, additioanl coding may be required.
* Any questions please contact [support@qubitproducts.com](mailto:support@qubitproducts.com), we'd be happy to help!
